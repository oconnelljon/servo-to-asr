Creates ASRs for the Servo Sipper samples based on the pickaxe copy-paste data in excel.
This script is designed to be ran from within the macro enabled excel workbook template included with this script.
The macro will run on the current workbook that is calling the script, but the script needs to be in the same directory as the workbook!



**Requirements to run**

- Python 3.7 or greater. 3.9.5 or greater recommended.
- Developer tab enabled in Excel.
- Excel extension "xlwings" must be installed.  This is a free extension that integrates python with excel in a more efficient manner than if accessing python from excel alone.
- Template file:  siteID_date_depthm_picaxe_Template.xlsm




**Installation notes**

Use the requirements.txt file located in the main directory to ensure all required python packages are installed.
This can be done by running the following command in the python interpreter:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You may need to specify the exact path to requirements.txt such as `pip install -r c:\workspace\requirements.txt`



**xlwings installation**

Due to permissions and PATH variations on our computers, a manual install of this excel addin is easiest.
The following link offers a good explanation for manually installing:  https://training.xlwings.org/courses/270054/lectures/4231276
Essentially you need to copy the xlwings.xlam file in

`~Your python installation directory~\site-packages\xlwings\addin`

to 

`%AppData%\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART  <- copy paste in windows explorer to go directly to XLSTART folder.`

Default user installations of python generally get put in %appdata%\python

Then enable the xlwings addin by opening excel -> Developer tab -> Excel Add-ins (Gear icon) -> Browse -> Go to %AppData%\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART and select xlwings.xlam -> OK

Then in the Developer tab go to Visual Basic -> Tool drop down -> References -> Check xlwings -> OK

Finally, in the xlwings excel tab, make sure the interpreter path points to the python installation that has xlwings and the other requirements installed.  Something like: "c:\users\joconnell\.envs\asr_project\scripts\python.exe"

The Developer tab can be activated by going to File -> Options -> Customize Ribbon -> On the right hand side check "Developer" and hit OK.

That should do it!



**How to use the script**

Make a copy of the template file and rename it to our naming convention -> siteID_date_depthm.xlsm
Copy paste the picaxe data into excel and split the data to form the columns:

`SAM-ID	 Date-Time	 Temp	 Li-Batt	 Pic-Batt`

Make sure the columns already in there line up so the entire header is:

`SAM-ID	 Date-Time	 Temp	 Li-Batt	 Pic-Batt	volume	comment	asr_comment	invalid	type`

The picaxe data headers come with weird spacing.  Do not adjust.

Enter in your servo data and relavent site data in columns G-J.  If needed, the site data in G-J can be moved by selecting the named range called station_info in excel and dragging the selection elsewhere.  The script references the named range, not the specific cells.  When you are ready to generate the ASRs, click the "Generate ASRs" button!

The output ASRs will be placed in the exports folder and will be named in the format "StationID_-first valid sample datetime-_depth_NWQL_ASR_Servo.docx"
The process should be done in ~10 seconds.  Rerunning the macro will overwrite the ASR if any changes need to be made.



**Column usage and definitions**

- volume: Integer number, volume of sample, do not include units.
- comment: String, any comment you want, will not be included in the ASR.
- asr_comment: String, this comment will be added to the ASR in the "Comments to NWQL field."
- invalid: String, default blank, mark with the letter x if you want this sample excluded from the ASR.  Note samples without a volume are excluded by default.
- type: String, enter fa or ra, is this a filtered or raw sample?  This is generally already filled for you.
