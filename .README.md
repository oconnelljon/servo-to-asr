Creates ASRs for the Servo Sipper samples based on the pickaxe copy-paste data in excel.
This script is designed to be ran from within the macro enabled excel workbook template included with this script.
The macro will run on the current workbook that is calling the script, but the script needs to be in the same directory as the workbook!


**Requirements to run**

- Python 3.7 or greater. 3.10.4 or greater recommended.
- Developer tab enabled in Excel.
- Excel extension "xlwings" must be installed.  This is a free extension that integrates python with excel in a more efficient manner than if accessing python from excel alone.
- Template file:  siteID_date_depthm_picaxe_Template.xlsm


**Installation notes**
open powershell and navigate to servo-to-asr folder.
Every command entered in powershell should be from the root directory.
	python -m pip install pipx
	python -m pipx install pipenv
	pipenv shell
	pipenv install
If using requirements.txt file then use:
	pipenv install -r path/to/requirements.txt

**xlwings installation**
pipenv shell
xlwings addin install

If not already enabled, the Developer tab in Excel can be activated by going to File -> Options -> Customize Ribbon -> On the right hand side check "Developer" and hit OK.
Then enable the xlwings addin by opening excel -> Developer tab -> Excel Add-ins (Gear icon) -> Browse -> Go to %AppData%\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART and select xlwings.xlam -> OK
Then in the Developer tab go to Visual Basic -> Tool drop down -> References -> Check xlwings -> OK

In the xlwings tab, make sure the interpreter path points to the python installation that has xlwings and the other requirements installed.  Something like: "c:\users\joconnell\.envs\asr_project\scripts\python.exe" Without quotes.
The pipenv venv path can be revealed by the command:
pipenv --venv

Enter the directory path for the excel.py folder into PYTHONPATH.  Something like:
"c:\users\joconnell\.source\repos\servo-to-asr\program_data" Without quotes.

Check the "Add workbook to PYTHONPATH" box.

This allows the python interpreter to import excel.py without installing it as a package to the venv.

That should do it!



**How to use the script**

Make a copy of the template file and rename it to our naming convention -> siteID_date_depthm.xlsm
Copy paste the picaxe data into excel and split the data to form the columns:

`SAM-ID	 Date-Time	 Temp	 Li-Batt	 Pic-Batt`

Make sure the columns already in there line up so the entire header is:

`SAM-ID	 Date-Time	 Temp	 Li-Batt	 Pic-Batt	volume	comment	asr_comment	invalid	type`

The picaxe data headers come with weird spacing.  Do not adjust.

Enter in your servo data and relavent site data in columns G-J.  The script references named ranges, not the specific cells.  When you are ready to generate the ASRs, click the "Generate ASRs" button!

The output ASRs will be placed in the ASRs folder and will be named in the format "StationID_-first valid sample datetime-_depth_NWQL_ASR_Servo.pdf"
The process should be done in ~10 seconds.  Rerunning the macro will overwrite the ASR if any changes need to be made.
All ASRs have a local copy generated in the excel file under the ASRx sheets.  These can be modified and printed manually if needed.
There is a log sheet to help debug if something goes wrong.


**Column usage and definitions**

- volume: Integer number, volume of sample, do not include units.
- comment: String, any comment you want, will not be included in the ASR.
- asr_comment: String, this comment will be added to the ASR in the "Comments to NWQL field."
- invalid: String, default blank, mark with the letter x if you want this sample excluded from the ASR.  Note samples without a volume are not excluded.
- type: String, enter fa or ra, is this a filtered or raw sample?  This is already filled for you.

'Procedure to use the RunPython command of xlwings add-in
 
    RunPython ("import excel; excel.main()")  'import excel refers to the excel.py file in the same directory as the excel file.  excel.main() is calling the main() function in excel.py
